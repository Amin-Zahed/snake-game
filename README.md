# 🐍 Snake Game

A classic Snake game built Fully **Responsive Design** for optimal viewing on all devices with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Zustand**, **Shadcn/UI**, and **TailwindCSS**.

## 🚀 Features

- It has a control panel at the bottom of the screen for easy use on any type of device.
- You can change the game theme to one of three modes: dark, light, and system.
- You can change the color of the snake to any color you want and return it to its original color whenever you like.
- It has the ability to play and pause music while playing the game.
- You can pause the game during play and then resume it at
  any time. The game will start again from the same point where it
  was stopped.
- Each time the snake eats a frog, 10 points will be added to your score. You can see your score in the top center of the screen.
- You can also see your highest score ever earned in the top right of the screen.
- In this game, you have 3 lives, which are displayed in the upper left corner, and you lose one of them every time the snake's head collides with its body.
- After you lose your last life, the game will end and the game will start over from the beginning without refreshing the web page.
- If you close this web page and return to it later, you
  will see that your snake color and page theme are the same as the
  snake color and page theme you last selected.
